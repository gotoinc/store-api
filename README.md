Simplified API for an online groceries delivery system
that will be used by a front-end React Application. A user should be able to buy
groceries from the suppliers to receive in their home. The user can browse,
search, and filter the products to select what they want to buy. The user can add
products to the shopping cart before ordering. A supplier should only sell one
type of groceries, for example, one supplier will only sell meat products and the
other seafood items. Functionalities are listed below
- Design the online groceries delivery system data models (attributes)
  and their relationships that make the most sense and are comprehensive.
- Design the data models for the system. Example data models can be (but not
  limited to) User, Supplier and Product and their associations.
- Design token based authentication for users (sign up, sign in and log out).
- Design an API endpoint that will return all the products.
- Products can be filtered by categories.
- Products should be searchable by name or sku.
- Ruby version 2.6.5 or higher and Rails version 6.1
- Use of any open source gem that makes the life easier.
- Design API endpoint for users to favorite certain products
- Design API endpoint that returns all the favorite products for a logged in user
